Assessment Goals

1. Establish a system flow of a problem to derive the solution
2. To determine the running time function of an algorithm but it is actually implemented
3. To understand combinatorial problems and determining optimal solutions
4. Understanding graph theory and its implementation
5. Implementing algorithm design approaches in determining solutions and write the actual programs.
