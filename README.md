# AdvancedAlgorith
Summative 
Assessment Goals

1. Establish a system flow of a problem to derive the solution
2. To determine the running time function of an algorithm but it is actually implemented
3. To understand combinatorial problems and determining optimal solutions
4. Understanding graph theory and its implementation
5. Implementing algorithm design approaches in determining solutions and write the actual programs.

Numbe 1 

#                           PSDEUDO

# Define function with A and B points as parameter=1
# Initialize A ponts to zero=1
# Initialize B points to zero=1
# For loop for looping around B’s and alice’s points=n
# If statement to check if in alice’s array,a[i] is greater than b[i] in B’s array=1
# A will get point=1
# If  a[i] in alice’s array is less than b[i] in B’s array=1
# B will get point=1
# Return A and B points=1
# call function to print A and B ponts=1
